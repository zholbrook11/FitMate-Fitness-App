Team Name: Team FitnessApp

Project: This project is a prototype fitness app called FitMate, designed to help users track their workouts, monitor their diet, and set personal fitness goals. The aim is to build a simple yet functional tool that provides workout and dietary guidance, making it easier for users to stay on top of their fitness routine and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

The app will be useful for individuals looking to manage their fitness goals in one place. By tracking workouts, monitoring calories, and getting advice, users can better understand and improve their health.

Users will interact with the app to input workouts, check diet recommendations, set and review fitness goals, and receive general advice for staying fit, making it a straightforward and supportive companion for anyone aiming to stay active and health-conscious.

Plan: I will first build the app with an emphasis on functionality, then proceed to add an asthetic GUI to tie everything together.

Estimated effort requirement - 8/10
